# Knight's Trial

Knight's Trial is a 2D side-scrolling action game where you play as a valiant knight battling endless waves of enemies. The game doesn’t end until you fall — every fight is a test of endurance. Defeat as many foes as you can, rack up your score, and push yourself to survive longer with each run.
